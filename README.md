# Welcome to Pesky's Gauranlen Armory Redux!

Here you will find a basic description of the mod and an explanation on how to play with the mod.

### First Steps
- Find a Gauranlen Seed and plant it.
- Research Rootcraft.
- Slaughter Immature Dryads and craft them into Simple Essences. Here you will unlock basic uses for other dryads.
- Gather more Gauranlen Seeds, plant them, and make use of the other dryads.
